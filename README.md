## About

This is a starter boilerplate app I've put together using the following technologies:

* [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
* [Vue Router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)
* [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)
* [Vue Resource](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com)
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io) for ES6 and ES7 magic
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling
* [Webpack Dev Middleware](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-middleware.html)
* [Webpack Hot Middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware)
* [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader), [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader) and [less-loader](https://github.com/webpack/less-loader) to allow import of stylesheets in plain css, sass and less,
